# Barkley

College project created to implement Barkley's algorithm.

The algorithm consists of synchronizing machine clocks in a network. One of the machines will be the master and the other slaves.
The master asks the slave times and calculates a delta based on their time, with the delta the master calculates the slave's new times and sends them up to date.
